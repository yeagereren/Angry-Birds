As soon as you will open the project, you will be directed to the main screen which is the loading screen. You'll stay there for around three seconds then you will be transferred to the home screen where you will be provided with two options to either begin with a new game or load a saved game. On clicking on the relevant option you will be directed towards the choose level screen i.e., the screen on which you will choose your level. After selecting the level you will be directed towards the actual game screen. Here, the user can play the game. You can pause the game by clicking on the pause button on the top right corner. At any stage in the game you can go to previous screen by clicking on the back button in the top left corner. Also on the level screen where the user is playing the game if you click W on the keyboard you will be able to view the screen which the user will get when he or she will win the game and on clicking l you will get to see the screen which the user will see when he or she will lose the game. You can click escape button on the keyboard to pause the game. Also on the choose level screen you can click on 1 on the keyboard to choose level one.
